== NAME
shards - dependency manager for the Crystal Language

== SYNOPSIS
*shards* [_<general_options>_...] [_<command>_] [_<command_options>_...]

== DESCRIPTION
Manages dependencies for Crystal projects and libraries with reproducible
installs across computers and systems.

== USAGE
_shards_ requires the presence of a _shard.yml_ file in the project
folder (working directory). This file describes the project and lists
dependencies that are required to build it. See *shard.yml*(5) for more
information on its format. A default file can be created by running _shards init_.

Running _shards install_ resolves and installs the
specified dependencies. The installed versions are written into a
*shard.lock* file for using the exact same dependency versions when
running _shards install_ again.

If your shard builds an application, both *shard.yml* and *shard.lock*
should be checked into version control to provide reproducible
dependency installs.
If it is only a library for other shards to depend
on, *shard.lock* should _not_ be checked in, only *shard.yml*. It’s good
advice to add it to *.gitignore*.

== COMMANDS

If no _command_ is given, *install* command will be run by default.

To see the available options for a particular command, use _--help_ after the command.

*build* [_<targets>_] [_<build_options>_...]::
Builds the specified _<targets>_ in *bin* path. If no targets are specified,
all are built.
This command ensures all dependencies are installed, so it is not necessary
to run *shards install* before.
+
All _<build_options>_ following the command are delegated to *crystal build*.

*check*::
Verifies that all dependencies are installed and requirements are satisfied.
+
Exit status:
+
[horizontal]
*0*::: Dependencies are satisfied.
*1*::: Dependencies are not satisfied.

*init*::
Initializes a default _shard.yml_ in the current folder.

*install* [--frozen] [--without-development] [--production]::
Resolves and installs dependencies into the _lib_ folder. If not already
present, generates a _shard.lock_ file from resolved dependencies, locking
version numbers or Git commits.
+
Reads and enforces locked versions and commits if a _shard.lock_ file is
present. The *install* command may fail if a locked version doesn't match
a requirement, but may succeed if a new dependency was added, as long as it
doesn't generate a conflict, thus generating a new _shard.lock_ file.
+
--
--frozen:: Strictly installs locked versions from _shard.lock_. Fails if _shard.lock_ is missing.
--without-development:: Does not install development dependencies.
--production:: same as _--frozen_ and _--without-development_
--

*list* [--tree]::
Lists the installed dependencies and their versions.
+
Specifying _--tree_ arranges nested dependencies in a tree, instead of a flattened list.

*lock* [--update [<shards>...]]::
Resolves dependencies and creates or updates the _shard.lock_ file as per
the *install* command, but never installs the dependencies.
+
Specifying _--update_ follows the same semantics as the *update*
command.

*outdated* [--pre]::
Lists dependencies that are outdated.
+
When _--pre_ is specified, pre-release versions are also considered.

*prune*::
Removes unused dependencies from _lib_ folder.

*update* [<shards>...]::
Resolves and updates all dependencies into the _lib_ folder,
whatever the locked versions in the _shard.lock_ file.
Eventually generates a new _shard.lock_ file.
+
Specifying _shards_ will update these dependencies only, trying to be as
conservative as possible with other dependencies, respecting the locked versions
in the _shard.lock_ file.

*version* [_<path>_]::
Prints the current version of the shard located at _path_ (defaults to current
directory).

To see the available options for a particular command, use *--help*
after a command.

== GENERAL OPTIONS

--version::
  Prints the version of _shards_.

-h, --help::
  Prints usage synopsis.

--no-color::
  Disables colored output.

--local::
  Don't update remote repositories, use the local cache only.

--ignore-crystal-version::
  Do not enforce crystal version restrictions on shards.

-q, --quiet::
  Decreases the log verbosity, printing only warnings and errors.

-v, --verbose::
  Increases the log verbosity, printing all debug statements.

== INSTALLATION
Shards is usually distributed with Crystal itself. Alternatively, a
separate _shards_ package may be available for your system.

To install from source, download or clone
https://github.com/crystal-lang/shards[the repository] and run
*make CRFLAGS=--release*. The compiled binary is in _bin/shards_ and
should be added to *PATH*.

== Environment variables

SHARDS_OPTS::
Allows general options to be passed in as environment variable.
*Example*: _SHARDS_OPTS="--ignore-crystal-version" shards update_

SHARDS_CACHE_PATH::
Defines the cache location. In this folder, shards stores local copies of remote
repositories.
Defaults to _.cache/shards_ in the home directory (_$XDG_CACHE_HOME_ or _$HOME_)
or the current directory.

SHARDS_INSTALL_PATH::
Defines the location where dependecies are installed.
Defaults to _lib_.

SHARDS_BIN_PATH::
Defines the location where executables are installed.
Defaults to _bin_.

CRYSTAL_VERSION::
Defines the crystal version that dependencies should be resolved against.
Defaults to the output of _crystal env CRYSTAL_VERSION_.

SHARDS_OVERRIDE::
Defines the location of _shard.override.yml_.

== Files

shard.yml::
Describes a shard project including its dependencies.
See *shard.yml*(5) for documentation.

shard.override.yml::
Local overrides to _shard.yml_.

shard.lock::
Lockfile that stores information about the installed versions.
+
If your shard builds an application, *shard.lock* should be checked into version
control to provide reproducible dependency installs.
+
If it is only a library for other shards to depend on, *shard.lock* should _not_
be checked in, only *shard.yml*. It’s good advice to add it to *.gitignore*.
