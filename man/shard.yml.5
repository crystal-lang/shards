.SH "NAME"
shard.yml \- metadata for projects managed by *shards*(1)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The file \fBshard.yml\fP is a YAML file with metadata about a project managed by shards, known as a \fBshard\fP. It must contain at least \fIname\fP and \fIversion\fP attributes plus optional additional attributes.
.sp
Both libraries and applications will benefit from \f(CRshard.yml\fP.
.sp
The metadata for libraries are expected to have more information (e.g., list of
authors, description, license) than applications that may only have a name, version and
dependencies.
.SH "FORMAT"
.sp
The file must be named \fBshard.yml\fP and be a valid YAML file with UTF\-8 encoding.
It must not contain duplicate attributes in any mapping.
It should use an indent of 2 spaces.
It should not use advanced YAML features, only simple mappings, sequences and
strings (Failsafe Schema).
.SH "REQUIRED ATTRIBUTES"

A restriction to indicate which are the supported crystal versions. This will
usually express a lower and upper\-bound constraints (string, recommended)

When resolving dependencies, only the versions that comply with the current
crystal will be candidates. You can pass \fI\-\-ignore\-crystal\-version\fP to disregard this

When just a version number is used it has a different semantic compared to dependencies:
\fIx.y.z\fP will be interpreted as \fI~> x.y, >= x.y.z\fP (ie: \fI>= x.y.z, < (x+1).0.0\fP) honoring semver.

\fBdependencies\fP

A list of required dependencies (mapping).

list of attributes (mapping) that depend on the resolver type.

\fBdevelopment_dependencies\fP
.RS 4
A list of dependencies required to work on the project, but not necessary
to build and run the project (mapping).
.sp
They will be installed for the main project or library itself.
When the library is installed as a dependency for another project the
development dependencies will never be installed.
.sp
Development dependencies follow the same scheme as dependencies.

.RS 4
The URL to a website providing the project\(cqs documentation for online browsing (string).
.RE
.sp
\fBexecutables\fP
.RS 4
A list of executables to be installed (sequence).
.sp
The executables can be of any type or language (e.g., shell, binary, ruby), must
exist in the \fIbin\fP folder of the Shard, and have the executable bit set (on
POSIX platforms). When installed as a dependency for another project the
executables will be copied to the \fIbin\fP folder of that project.
.sp
Executables are always installed last, after the \fIpostinstall\fP script is run, so
libraries can build the executables when they are installed by Shards.

\fBhomepage\fP
.RS 4
The URL of the project\(cqs homepage (string).
.RE
.sp
\fBlibraries\fP
.RS 4
A list of shared libraries the shard tries to link to (mapping).
.sp
This field is purely informational. It serves as a canonical way to discover
non Crystal dependencies in shards, both for tools as well as humans.
.sp
A shard must only list libraries it directly links to, it must not include
libraries that are only referenced by dependencies. It must include all libraries
it directly links to, regardless of a dependency doing it too.
.sp
It should map from the soname without any extension, path or version,
for example \fIlibsqlite3\fP for \fI/usr/lib/libsqlite3.so.0.8.6\fP, to a version
constraint.
.sp
The version constraint has the following format:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3

\fBrepository\fP

The URL of the project\(cqs canonical repository (string, recommended).
.sp
The URL should be compatible with typical VCS tools without modifications.
\fIhttp\fP/\fIhttps\fP is preferred over VCS schemes like \fIgit\fP.
It is recommended that this URL is publicly available.
.sp
Copies of a shard (such as mirrors, development forks etc.) should point to the same
canonical repository address, even if hosted at different locations.

Shards may run scripts automatically after certain actions. The scripts
themselves are mere shell commands.
.sp
\fBpostinstall\fP
.RS 4
The \fIpostinstall\fP hook of a dependency will be run whenever that dependency is
installed or upgraded in a project that requires it. This may be used to compile
a C library, to build tools to help working on the project, or anything else.
.sp
The script will be run from the dependency\(cqs installation directory, for example
\fIlib/foo\fP for a Shard named \fIfoo\fP.

\fBtargets\fP

A list of targets to build (mapping).
.sp
Each target begins with the name of the target as a key (string), then a list of
attributes (mapping). The target name is the built binary name, created in the
\fIbin\fP folder of the project.
.sp
\fBExample:\fP

.sp
\fBpath\fP

A Git repository URL (string).
.sp
The URL may be [any protocol](\c

supported by Git, which includes SSH, GIT and HTTPS.
.sp
The Git repository will be cloned, the list of versions (and associated
\fBshard.yml\fP) will be extracted from Git tags (e.g., \fIv1.2.3\fP).
.sp
One of the other attributes (\fIversion\fP, \fItag\fP, \fIbranch\fP or \fIcommit\fP) is
required. When missing, Shards will install the HEAD refs.
