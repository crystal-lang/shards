.TH SHARDS "1" "September 2018" "shards 0.8.1" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
shards \- dependency manager for the Crystal Language
.SH SYNOPSYS
.B
shards
[\fI<options>\fR...] [<\fIcommand\fR>]
.PP
If no \fIcommand\fR is given, \fBinstall\fR will be run by default.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Manages dependencies for Crystal projects and libraries with reproducible
installs across computers and systems.
.PP
Requires the presence of a \fIshard.yml\fR file. See \fBshard.yml\fR(5) for
more information on its format.
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
\fBbuild\fR [\fI<targets>\fR] [\fI<options>\fR...]
.RS 4
Builds the specified \fItargets\fR in \fBbin\fR path. If no targets are specified, all are built.
This command ensures all dependencies are installed, so it is not necessary to run \fBshards install\fR before.
.PP
All \fIoptions\fP following the command are delegated to \fBcrystal build\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fBcheck\fR
.RS 4
Verifies that all dependencies are installed and requirements are satisfied.
.SS
.RS 4
Exit status:
.PP
.TP 3
\fB0\fR
dependencies are satisfied,
.TP 3
\fB1\fR
dependencies aren't satisfied.
.RE
.PP
\fBinit\fR
.RS 4
Initializes a shard folder and creates a default \fIshard.yml\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fBinstall\fR
.RS 4
Resolves and installs dependencies into the \fIlib\fR folder. If not already
present, generates a \fIshard.lock\fR file from resolved dependencies, locking
version numbers or Git commits.
.PP
Reads and enforces locked versions and commits if a \fIshard.lock\fR file is
present. The \fBinstall\fR command may fail if a locked version doesn't match
a requirement, but may succeed if a new dependency was added, as long as it
doesn't generate a conflict, thus generating a new \fIshard.lock\fR file.
.RE
.PP
\fBlist\fR
.RS 4
Lists the installed dependencies and their versions.
.RE
.PP
\fBprune\fR
.RS 4
Removes unused dependencies from \fIlib\fR folder.
.RE
.PP
\fBupdate\fR
.RS 4
Resolves and updates all dependencies into the \fIlib\fR folder again,
whatever the locked versions and commits in the \fIshard.lock\fR file.
Eventually generates a new \fIshard.lock\fR file.
.RE
.PP
\fBversion\fR [\fI<path>\fR]
.RS 4
Prints the current version of the shard.
.RE

\fIshard.yml\fR and \fIshard.lock\fR are out of sync.
