# CHANGELOG

## UNRELEASED

Fixes:
- `install -t` isn't supported on macOS.

## v0.8.1 - 2018-06-17

Fixes:
- Git repositories cloned with v0.8.0 can't fetch new remote refs anymore,
  which totally broke the `update` command.
- The Path resolver incorrectly handled invalid symlinks.

## v0.8.0 - 2018-06-05 [REVOKED]

Features:
- Install shard executables inside project bin folder on shard install.
  See #126.

Changes:
- Global cache for cloned Git repositories, aside crystal cache
  (e.g. `~/.cache/shards`). Customizable with `SHARDS_CACHE_PATH`.
- Clone bare Git repositories instead of creating mirrors (fetch should be
  faster, and less space required on disk).
- Man pages are now in the `man` folder.
- Allow loose shard versioning, accepting semver-like versions and alternatives
  such as calver.

Fixes:
- Compatibility with Crystal 0.25.

## v0.7.2 - 2017-11-16

Features:

- Correct shard.yml parse error line:column reporting
